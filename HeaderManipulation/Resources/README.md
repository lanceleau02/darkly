# üé≠ Header Manipulation

## üìñ Definition

A **referer header manipulation attack** occurs when an attacker manipulates the HTTP Referer or User-Agent headers to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access to a system, or perform other malicious actions. The attack is based on tricking the server into accepting a manipulated or false header value that would otherwise be rejected.

**Key Characteristics of a Referer Header Manipulation Attack:**

1. **Header Manipulation:** The attacker changes the Referer and User-Agent headers in the HTTP request to mimic a trusted source. In the given example, the Referer header is set to "https://www.nsa.gov/" and the User-Agent is set to "ft_bornToSec", which are presumably validated by the server to allow further actions.

2. **Bypassing Access Controls:** Many web applications implement basic security checks, such as verifying that requests come from trusted sources or using specific browser identifiers. Manipulating these headers can bypass such controls and trick the system into providing access to restricted resources, such as flags or private data.

3. **Exploitation of Insecure Trust Models:** The system might improperly trust the headers for validation purposes without checking for their authenticity or considering that headers can be easily spoofed. This creates a vulnerability that attackers can exploit.

4. **Possible Outcomes of Such Attacks:**
	- Access to restricted pages or resources by exploiting the header manipulation.
	- Information disclosure, such as flags or sensitive data, by bypassing security mechanisms relying on referer and user-agent checks.
	- Unintended side effects if the web application mistakenly trusts manipulated headers as legitimate.

In summary, referer header manipulation attacks exploit poorly implemented or unvalidated access controls that rely on HTTP headers to determine trustworthiness, allowing attackers to gain access to unauthorized resources.

## üîç Discovery

While navigating on the **Home** page, we clicked on the "BornToSec" copyright text in the footer, then we land on a weird page with a music and an Albatroz photo. After some researches, we got the idea to look at the page's source code (Ctrl + U). Further on the page, we see "You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/"." and "Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.". The first advice tell us that the request must come from `https://www.nsa.gov/` (`Referer`) and the browser used must have `ft_bornToSec` as `User-Agent`. So after many tries, we find this command:

```bash
curl -A "ft_bornToSec" -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" 'http://<ip>/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f' | grep flag
```

This command uses the curl tool to send an HTTP request to a specified URL, while manipulating the `User-Agent` and `Referer` headers. The `-A "ft_bornToSec"` option sets a custom `User-Agent` header, making the request appear as if it's coming from a specific browser identified as "ft_bornToSec". The `-e "https://www.nsa.gov/"` option sets the `Referer` header to simulate that the request is coming from the NSA's official website. After making the request, the output is filtered with `grep flag` to search for and display any lines containing the word "flag", indicating the possible presence of a flag or sensitive information on the targeted page.

## üèÅ Flag
 
1. Execute this command `curl -A "ft_bornToSec" -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" 'http://<ip>/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f' | grep flag`

## üîß Patch

Many defensive measures can be taken, but here are the main ones:

1. **Do Not Rely on Headers for Authentication or Authorization**
	- **Use Robust Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Always authenticate users using secure methods such as OAuth, JWT, or session-based tokens rather than relying on headers alone.
	- **Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement strong role-based access controls that check whether the user has permission to access certain pages or perform specific actions, irrespective of the HTTP headers.
	- **Do Not Use `Referer` as a Sole Trust Mechanism:** The `Referer` header can be easily manipulated by attackers, so never use it alone to verify the origin of requests. Instead, use secure, session-based checks.
2. **Validate the Referer Header Properly**
	- **Verify `Referer` Against a Set List of Trusted Domains:** If using the `Referer` header for access control, ensure that it is validated against a predefined list of trusted, known domains (e.g., your own domain or other trusted external sites).
	- **Implement Strict Matching:** Perform a strict comparison of the full URL in the `Referer` header, ensuring it exactly matches the expected URL or domain, without allowing partial matches.
3. **Use Secure HTTP Headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options)**
	- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use the Content-Security-Policy header to limit the domains that can be used in the `Referer` header. For example, you can configure CSP to only allow trusted sources for `Referer` values.
	- **X-Frame-Options Header:** Prevent the application from being embedded in iframes from untrusted domains, reducing the potential for clickjacking and referer-based attacks.
4. **Sanitize Input and Enforce Output Encoding**
	- **Sanitize User Input:** Any data coming from the user, including headers and URL parameters, should be properly sanitized and validated to ensure it doesn't contain harmful payloads.
	- **Output Encoding:** Ensure that any data displayed to users from request headers or URL parameters is properly encoded to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
