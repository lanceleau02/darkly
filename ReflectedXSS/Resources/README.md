# ‚ùå Reflected XSS

## üìñ Definition

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into a web page viewed by other users. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser, steal session cookies, deface content, or perform other malicious actions.

**Types of XSS:**

1. **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and then executed when other users load the page containing that script.

2. **Reflected XSS:** The script is reflected off the server, typically through user input, without being stored.

3. **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability exists in the client-side code, and the attack is executed through manipulation of the DOM by the attacker.

This breach is a **Reflected XSS** one, since the input (e.g., the word "script") is immediately reflected back in the response.

## üîç Discovery

While navigating on the **Home** page, we noticed the NSA logo was clickable. So we tried to click on it and we land on a page with the same logo. After a little digging, we saw this in the URL:

```URL
http://<ip>/index.php?page=media&src=nsa
```

And particularly this part: `&src=nsa` because it means that we can replace the `nsa` parameter with a malicious payload. After many researches, we found this payload:

```URL
data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgncGF5bG9hZCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+
```

But what does this gibberish mean? Ok, let's breakdown it:

1. **Data URI Scheme:**
	- The `data`: scheme allows embedding inline data, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, directly in a URL.
	- In this case, `data:text/html;base64,` decodes to an inline HTML/JavaScript snippet.
2. **Base64 Payload Decoded:**
	- The base64-encoded string `PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgncGF5bG9hZCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+` decodes to: `<script>alert('payload')</script>`
	- This injects a `<script>` tag into the page, causing the browser to execute `alert('payload')`.

If the server or client-side code directly uses the parameter without sanitization (e.g., inserting it into a webpage or evaluating it), the script runs in the context of the affected domain.

## üèÅ Flag

1. Go on the "Home" page
2. Click on the NSA logo
3. In the URL, replace the "nsa" by `data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgncGF5bG9hZCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+`

## üîß Patch

Many defensive measures can be taken, but here are the main ones:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
	- **Validate Input:** Check all incoming parameters to ensure they match the expected format. Reject or sanitize inputs that:
		- Contain potentially malicious content (e.g., `<script>`, `data:`, `javascript:`).
		- Use prohibited protocols like `data:`.
	- **Whitelist Validation:** Only allow values from a predefined, safe list.
	- **Remove Dangerous Characters:** Strip characters like `<`, `>`, `"` if they are unnecessary for the parameter.
2. **Output Encoding**
	- **HTML Encoding:**
		- Encode all user-supplied data before inserting it into the HTML response.
		- For example, if the input is `data:text/html...`, encode it so it displays as text rather than executing.
	- **Contextual Encoding:**
		- Use the right encoding for the context (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, or URL encoding).
3. **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP)**
	- A CSP restricts the types of scripts and content that can run on your site, mitigating XSS and injection attacks.
	- In this case, the CSP will block inline JavaScript, such as the malicious `<script>` tag.
4. **Restrict Dangerous URI Schemes**
	- Block the use of unsafe protocols like `data:`, `javascript:`, or `vbscript:` in URL parameters.
	- Server-side validation should explicitly disallow these protocols:
```python
if user_input.startswith("data:") or user_input.startswith("javascript:"):
	return "Invalid URL"
```
5. **Avoid Reflecting Unsanitized Input**
	- Ensure that URL parameters are not directly reflected in the HTML output without sanitization or escaping.
